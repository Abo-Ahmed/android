        <h2>People with specific needs</h2>
        People’s needs may vary in emergency situations. There may be people who are frail; have a
        visual or hearing impairment; have mobility problems and use walking aids or wheelchairs;
        have limited walking or standing ability; are pregnant; have heart conditions or asthma or
        are prone to panic attacks; or they may get claustrophobic.<br><br>

        <i><b>Responsibility of the person with a disability</b></i>
        Whether your disability is of a temporary or permanent nature, wherever possible it is
        important that you know what your needs are and plan ahead for emergency situations and/or evacuation.<br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are an occupant of a University building or regular visitor and have specific
                needs, take the initiative to seek out the relevant Wardens or speak to your
                Supervisor / School Manager and consult them regarding your needs.<br><br></li>
            <li>Consider who you might ask for help and communicate your needs.<br><br></li>
            <li>Remember, you are encouraged to specify what assistance (if any) you may require
                from other people during an emergency. Do not assume that people around you will
                know what to do. If you are confident in giving instructions it can prevent being
                hindered by others offering inappropriate assistance.</li>
        </ol>

        <i><b>Assisting people with physical disabilities</b></i>
        <ol>
            <li>Do not provide physical guidance, hold, lift or carry a conscious person without
                their permission. This includes pushing someone in a wheelchair, or ‘hurrying a
                person along’ by pushing them.<br><br></li>
            <li>Ask what assistance the person requires (such as clearing the path before them,
                walking alongside or behind on steps). Try to avoid offering advice or pre-empting
                what the person needs if you do not know the person.<br><br></li>
            <li>If a person is reliant on a wheelchair for mobility and there is no access available
                to get down stairs, another person should wait with them in a fire isolated stairwell
                until emergency services arrive, as it is the safest place. Ensure that the Building Warden is advised.<br><br></li>
            <li>If someone needs to be transferred or assisted from the floor, requiring a full body
                lift, it is best to get Fire and Emergency Services involved. Try providing a chair
                for the person to climb up on to. Do not try to lift them up unless you are trained to do so.<br><br></li>
            <li>Do not carry a person in their wheelchair down stairs. Either wait for their advice
                on how to proceed (minimum of two people required) or wait for emergency personnel.</li>
        </ol>

        <i><b>People who may be disoriented or having a panic attack</b></i>
        <ol>
            <li>Reassure the person by talking calmly to them. Tell them that you will stay with them.<br><br></li>
            <li>Get the person to control their breathing. Breathe in and breathe out in unison to
                the count of three. Use your hands in an up and down motion to signal the tempo. Maintain eye contact.</li>
        </ol>
