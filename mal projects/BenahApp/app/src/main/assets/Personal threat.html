        <h2>Personal threat</h2>
        <i><b>Violent / threatening person</b></i>
        <ol>
            <li>If safe to do so, note and report such persons – phone Security (call 2222) or your Supervisor or Area Warden.<br><br></li>
            <li>If confronted, obey instructions if safe to do so:</li>

            <li>Make it easy for the person to leave the building/area.<br><br></li>
